A critical component of the Utah Design System that will help build trust with visitors is the
“Utah: An official website” or “Utah: An official state website” identification text and graphical
element that will appear in the header and footer of all official state of Utah sites. A site
displaying this mark must be an official website for the state of Utah. No portion of this mark may
be used on non-official websites, communications, or applications.
