# utah-design-system
The Utah Design System is a set of guidelines and examples for website development. The goal is for the
citizens of the State of Utah to have a common experience among State of Utah online resources
so that they feel safe, engaged, and empowered.

The State of Utah Design System's first goal is knowledge and developer tooling. Knowledge is provided via 
the [Utah Design System Site](https://designsystem.utah.gov) and direct conversations with the 
Digital Experience Team (DXP). We love to talk. Please [contact us](https://designsystem.utah.gov/resources/gettingStarted) with anything.

You can also follow along and submit pull requests at our [GitHub](https://github.com/utahdts/utah-design-system).

We provide the developer assets that we used in constructing the State of Utah Design System website,
which may increase the easiness of incorporating the State of Utah Design System and make developer
adoption simpler. Please [contact us](https://designsystem.utah.gov/resources/gettingStarted) with any
tooling you have created or found useful, so we can share it. See below for more details on available assets.
