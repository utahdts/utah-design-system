# Utah Design System
The Utah Design System consists of reusable user interface components, valuable resources, and guiding principles that empower teams to craft consistent, accessible, secure, and scalable user experiences for websites and applications.

The first goal of the Utah Design System is to provide teams with the principals and standards required for State of Utah websites and applications.
These standards are provided via the [Utah Design System Site](https://designsystem.utah.gov). You may also directly connect with the
Digital Experience Team (DXP). We would love to hear your input or answer any questions you might have.
Please [contact us](https://designsystem.utah.gov/resources/gettingStarted) with anything.

The second goal is to provide a complete set of CSS and code examples for web components, patterns, and templates.

Additionally, we provide the developer assets (React) that we used in constructing the Utah Design System website,
which may increase the ease of incorporating the State of Utah Design System and make developer
adoption simpler. Please [contact us](https://designsystem.utah.gov/resources/gettingStarted) with any
tooling you have created or found useful, so we can share it.

You can follow along and submit pull requests at our [GitHub](https://github.com/utahdts/utah-design-system) repository.
