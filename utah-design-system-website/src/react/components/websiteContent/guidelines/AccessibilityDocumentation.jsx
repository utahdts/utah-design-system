        One of the top goals at the State of Utah, is to make websites and applications, across our many different agencies, accessible for
        all people including those with varying impairments. By prioritizing accessibility, we demonstrate our commitment to those we serve
        by fostering a sense of inclusivity, and ultimately enhance the user experience for everyone.

      <h3 id="section-limited-vision">Limited or No Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that people have varying levels of vision capability or may have issues with sensory overload. To account for these users
        we focus on color contrast and sizing. Both of these areas will help the user see the text and components on your site more clearly.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section-limited-vision-general-guidelines">General vision guidelines</h4>
      <ul className="mb-spacing">
        <li><strong>General text.</strong> Text size should be a minimum of <code>16px</code> (<code>1rem</code>) and its contrast ratio should be a minimum <code>4.5:1</code>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Images and Icons.</strong>
          <ul>

            <li>Graphical objects that do not provide meaning nor interaction have no contrast requirements.</li>
            <li>
              All images and icons that contribute to the content require meaningful alternative text. This can be achieved primarily by adding
              the <code>alt</code> property to the image. For non-semantic <Link to={pageUrls.images}>images</Link> or <Link to={pageUrls.icons}>icons</Link> you
              can also achieve this by applying an <code>aria-label</code> to the element.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Color representation.</strong> Avoid using colors to represent important information, such as red to
          mean &quot;danger&quot; or &quot;warning&quot;. Individuals that are challenged by red-green or other forms of color blindness will need additional indicators
          such as <Link to={pageUrls.typography}>text</Link> or <Link to={pageUrls.icons}>icons</Link> to convey the correct meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assistive technology.</strong> Many components in the Utah Design System require additional ARIA attributes and testing to ensure
          they are usable by those using assistive technology, such as screen readers and braille reader devices. Accessible Rich Internet Applications(ARIA) involves
          a range of <code>roles</code> and <code>attributes</code> designed to enhance web content and web applications, with a specific focus on improving accessibility
          for individuals with disabilities.

      </ul>

      <h4 id="section-limited-vision-contrast">Contrast requirement</h4>
      <p>
        State agencies are required by statute to &quot;conform at minimum to W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1.
        (<em><ExternalLink href="https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63A/Chapter16/63A-16-S209.html">ยง63A-16-209</ExternalLink> / <ExternalLink href="https://adminrules.utah.gov/public/rule/R895-14/Current%20Rules">R895-14</ExternalLink>. Access to Information Technology for Users with Disabilities.</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The WCAG 2.1 consists of three levels of guidance: A, AA, and AAA. <strong>State agencies are required to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines and are encouraged to strive to meet Level AAA guidelines whenever feasible</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All State of Utah agency websites must provide adequate contrast between text and its background (or an object and its background)
        so that it can be read or identified by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology).
        Contrast values are measured with the foreground color and the background color in a ratio such as: <code>3:1</code>, <code>4.5:1</code>, <code>7:1</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Utah Design System provides a color and contrast tool. The tool can be accessed by clicking the gear icon in the Utah Header at the top.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section-limited-vision-aaa-guidelines" className="mb-spacing">AA and AAA contrast guidelines (definitions)</h4>
      <h5>Normal Text and Bold Text (14px - 18px)</h5>
      <p>General text and images of text. See <Link to={pageUrls.typography}>Typography</Link>.</p>

      <h5>Large Text (19px Bold, 24px+)</h5>
      <p>Large-scale text and images of large-scale text. See <Link to={pageUrls.typography}>Typography</Link>.</p>

      <h5>User Interface Components</h5>

        etc. This guideline refers to the component&apos;s outer boundary when compared to the background upon which it sits. The component&apos;s different
        states must also be considered. A component&apos;s inactive state is not subject to this guideline.
      </p>

      <h5>Graphical Objects</h5>
      <p>
        Graphical objects refers to a visual depiction of content that is not presented in text form, such as a chart, map, or <Link to={pageUrls.icons}>icons</Link>.
        These objects can provide informational value to the content on the page or give context to an interactive element.

      <h3 id="section-motor-functionality" className="mt-spacing">Motor Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        Not all users have the ability to use a mouse or they have limited or involuntary motor control. Think of people with tremors,
        joint disorders, paralysis, or even missing limbs. In these cases they are reliant on keyboard functionality, have trouble
        clicking on small areas or have specialized hardware to help them navigate websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site should be designed to be navigated and functional using only the keyboard and they should never get stuck in any particular
        page element. This is crucial for those with mobility impairments.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section-motor-functionality-general-guidelines">General guidelines</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus events.</strong> This will visually indicate to the user where they are located on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hover events.</strong> These users will not be able to interact with any hover events (e.g. <Link to={pageUrls.tooltips}>tooltips</Link>). If the content
          is critical to understanding, be sure to give them an alternative source for the information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interactive content.</strong>  When possible, ensure that the user:
          <ul>
            <li>Can activate or dismiss content using the keyboard.</li>
            <li>Will be able to easily click the object (has a large clickable area).</li>
            <li>Has enough time to complete necessary tasks.</li>
            <li>Can correct any errors that may have been made.</li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="section-auditory" className="mt-spacing">Limited or No Auditory Perception</h3>
      <p>
        Many people suffer from hearing loss, which can be present in one or both ears, and they can have different levels of hearing
        impairment. Determine the importance of the information the audible content is conveying. If it is critical or adds informational
        value then there needs to be an alternative way to provide the information to those with hearing impairments. These individuals
        rely heavily on audio alternatives like transcripts and captions.
      </p>
      <h4 id="section-auditory-general-guidelines">General guidelines</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Audio Control.</strong> Depending on the type of auditory disability the user has, it may require adjustments to be
          made. Disable audio and video that starts automatically and use media players that give the user the option to play, pause, stop
          and adjust the volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Captions.</strong> Captions provide a text based alternative that is synchronized to the audio being played. It is highly
          recommended to use a media player that also allows the user to change the size and color of the captions. These can also be
          known as &quot;sub-titles&quot; and is available with most media players. To view more information on captions see
          the <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/">w3.org page on Captions/Subtitles</ExternalLink>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transcripts.</strong> Transcripts refers to a written version of the spoken content in an audio or video file. Not only
          does this benefit individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, but also people who may have difficulty understanding or processing
          spoken language. For more information on how to get or create transcripts please refer to
          the <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/#creating-transcripts+">w3.orgs&apos; information on Creating Transcripts</ExternalLink>.

      <h3 id="section-cognitive" className="mt-spacing">Cognitive Abilities</h3>
      <p>
        Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities encompass a wide spectrum of conditions. These disabilities have the potential to impact different functions
        of the nervous system, such as hearing, movement, vision, speech, and information processing. It is important to understand that these disabilities do not
        necessarily reflect a person&apos;s intelligence or cognitive capabilities.
      </p>
      <h4 id="section-cognitive-guidelines">General guidelines</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Organized content.</strong> Create coherent <Link to={pageUrls.headings}>heading</Link> structures to organize information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Readable content.</strong> Consider the wording and the line length. Could a 9th grader read and understand it? If not, consider reworking the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predictable functionality.</strong> Not all new features are welcome. Consider
          best practices and industry standards before implementing new user interface features. Hovering over <Link to={pageUrls.button}>buttons</Link> should not activate
          a <Link to={pageUrls.modals}>modal</Link>, however it is standard practice for the cursor to change when hovering over interactive content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Create a safe space.</strong> Try to stay away from flashing and repetitive animation or alarming colors and images. These can trigger health
          issues as well as induce emotional distress.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="section-forms" className="mt-spacing">Form Accessibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use a simple vertical layout.</strong> By arranging form elements vertically, each field is presented one below the other, creating a
            natural flow and making it easier for users to understand the order in which they need to provide their inputs. This layout helps improve
            usability and accessibility by reducing the cognitive load. It aligns with the way users typically read and process information from top to bottom,
            and allows for efficient scanning and completion of form fields, reducing potential confusion and errors.
          </p>
          <p>
          The following images depict different forms with the arrows indicating different tab orders. Horizontally arranged forms can create an undesirable user experience.
          Depending on the user, they are going to expect the cursor to land in a particular place. If it doesnโt go where they expect, it increases
          the cognitive load trying to figure out where the cursor will actually land.
          </p>

        <li>
          <strong>Use native html elements before using role and other aria attributes.</strong> Native HTML elements are designed to be accessible by default.
          They have built-in semantics that convey meaning to both users and assistive technologies. By using native elements, you provide a solid foundation for
          creating accessible web content without relying on additional ARIA attributes.
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <strong><em>The first rule of ARIA: Before you use ARIA, use native HTML elements and attributes first!</em></strong>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide visible focus indicators.</strong> Native html elements have default focus behavior that activates when the user clicks or tabs into it. If
          you customize a form element, the focus boundary requires a <code>3:1</code> contrast ratio to its background. Test to make sure that there is a visible focus state
          on each element, to guide the user through the form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tie a label to each form element.</strong> Use the form element <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> depending on the form element
          being used, to associate the label and the form element. This enables the user to click anywhere on the label to activate or focus on the input, thus expanding
          the surface area of the form element.

        <li>
          <strong>Group related form controls.</strong> The <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> element is useful when you have a logical grouping of form controls that belong together, such
          as a group of <Link to={pageUrls.radioButton}>radio buttons</Link>, <Link to={pageUrls.checkbox}>checkboxes</Link>, or related input fields. It is typically used
          in combination with a single <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> element, which provides a caption or description for the group of <Link to={pageUrls.forms}>form elements</Link>.

          <strong>Don&apos;t control element order.</strong> Ensure that the form controls are presented in the <code>HTML</code> exactly as they are displayed on the screen,
          without relying on <code>CSS</code> to rearrange them. This preserves the order in which form elements are narrated by screen readers, as they follow the sequence
          specified in the <code>HTML</code>. Also, do not alter the <code>tabindex</code> of the form element to control the tab order.
