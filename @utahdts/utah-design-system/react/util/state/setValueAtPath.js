/**
 * Deep cloning the entire state is rarely the desired functionality, especially
 * if there are large chunks of data in the state causing the clone to be slow.
 * Keep in mind that React does pointer comparison to see if an object has changed
 * so shallow cloning all objects in the path notifies React of changes along that path.
 * Methodology
 *   1) do a shallow clone of the state
 *   2) shallow clone the object that is changing and all the objects in the path to that object
 *   3) deep clone the new value
 *
 * note: if path to the object doesn't exist then it won't be created; but if the field in the object doesn't exist then it will be created
 *
 * ie field not there
 * state = { a: { b: { c: 3 } } }
 * path = a.b
 * field = d
 * value = 4
 * result: { a: { b: { d: 4, c: 3 } } }
 * note that the 'd' field did get created
 *
 * ie object not there
 * state = { a: { b: { c: 3 } } }
 * path = a.b.d
 * field = e
 * value = 4
 * result: { a: { b: { c: 3 } } }
 * note that the 'e' field did not get created because there is no 'd' object
